# Analyzing_American_Baby_Name_Trends

In this project, I used the following techniques: 
* CASE WHEN statements 
* Pattern matching using the LIKE operator
* Subqueries
* Common table expressions
* Window functions and joins
* Filtering grouped data 
* Filtering rows where they meet a criterion 
* Aggregation functions
